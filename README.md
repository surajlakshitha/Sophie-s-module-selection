<h2>Case file - Sophie’s module selection</h2><br>
<p>Sophie is a third-year student taking Finance course at the University of London. After the
module fair, she was told she has five more modules she needs to take: Business Strategy
(BS101), International Finance (FIN 300), one industry-based module, and any two finance
optional modules. An industry-based module is a requirement at the university that has an
industry internship component. Many of the industry-based modules are offered by the
School of Computer Science and Sophie would like to take one of those. In particular, two
modules she finds interesting are Business Computing (CS 101) and Web Design for Nonprofit
Organizations (CS 102). After looking at the finance optional module choices, she noticed four
potential finance modules: Data Analysis in Finance (FIN 315); Risk Management (FIN 316);
Options, Futures and Swaps (FIN 317); and Fixed Instruments and Markets (FIN 318). Sophie
would like to avoid morning classes because her parttime job requires her to work a few hours
mostly weekday mornings.</p>
<p>When she selects the modules for her third year, she would like to keep in mind her priorities.
Her priorities are first, the content of the module, second, the reputation of the instructor,
and third, the timing of the module. She decided she will assign a rating between 1 and 5 to
each module section under consideration. From the online class schedule, she has made a list
of module sections offered, as shown in Table 1. All the modules have at least two sections
to be chosen from. Some sections meet once a week for three hours, and some meet twice a
week alternating between one-hour and two-hour periods. An “hour” at the University is 55
minutes long.</p>
<p>To rate the module sections, Sophie considered three factors: content, instructor, and timing.
The rating is the weighted average of the three factor ratings. She rated the content of the
module based on her interest in it, using a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (extremely interested). The
reputation of the instructor is also a value from 1 to 5, coming from published student
comments and word of mouth from classmates. The timing of the module is also rated from
1 to 5 according to her own preference. The rating of the module is provided in the final
column of Table 1. Sophie wonders how to use this information to obtain a good selection of
modules for her third year.</p>
<p>The task of this case is to create a good selection of the modules for Sophie. </p>
